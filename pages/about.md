## About the Mayes Gray Collection
The Mayes Gray Collection is one of many image collections housed by the Meridian History Center and the Meridian Library District. The Mayes and Gray families are among the Meridian's early settlers.  Their descendants donated the images to the Meridian History Center so they could be enjoyed by all. The images in this collection range from 1890 to 1980 and are a wonderful snapshot into Meridian's past.

This project was made possible by a SHARP Operations Grant, funded by the Idaho Humanities Council and National Endowment for the Humanities.
