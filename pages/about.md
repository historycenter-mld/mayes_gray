## About the Mayes Gray Collection

The Mayes Gray Collection is one of many image collections housed by the Meridian History Center and the Meridian Library District. The Mayes and Gray families are some of the early settlers in the Meridian area. Their families have donated these images and they have been digitized and uploaded for all to enjoy.
